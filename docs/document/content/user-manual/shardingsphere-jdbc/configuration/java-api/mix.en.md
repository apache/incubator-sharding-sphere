The overlay between rule items in a mixed configuration is associated by the data source name and the table name.

If the previous rule is aggregation-oriented, the next rule needs to use the aggregated logical data source name configured by the previous rule when configuring the data source.
Similarly, if the previous rule is table aggregation-oriented, the next rule needs to use the aggregated logical table name configured by the previous rule when configuring the table.
